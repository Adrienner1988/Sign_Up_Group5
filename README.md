# Sign_Up_Group5
Group 5 week 1 weekend project


IMPORTANT NOTES : EACH member of the team must commit work. Also, a README.txt file will need to show each of your names and what file/code you completed. The project is not considered complete until it has been checked in (uploaded) to your GitHub account and the original team member's link posted to the Google Classroom assignment(each person individually). All photos can be placeholder images.

I took on the main role, breaking up the responsibilities of each group member, and setting up the HTML, CSS, and images folder in the VS Code workspace. 
I went through the provided zip file for the sign-up page and pulled only the images our group would need so the group could focus on coding. 
Used CSS grid link to setup the layout of the page and added the media queries for a responsive design
I also created the git repository and upstream.
