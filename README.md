# Sign_Up_Group5
Group 5 week 1 weekend project

I took on the main role, breaking up the responsibilities of each group member, and setting up the HTML, CSS, and images folder in the VS Code workspace. 
I went through the provided zip file for the sign-up page and pulled only the images our group would need so the group could focus on coding. 
I also created the git repository and upstream.
